# Privacy Policy for DriveLog

**Last updated: December 26, 2025**

## 1. Introduction
DriveLog ("we", "our", or "us") values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our DriveLog iOS application.

## 2. Data Collection and Storage
**We do not collect, store, or share any of your personal data.**

*   **Local Storage:** All data entered into DriveLog (including trip details, dates, and mileage) is stored locally on your device using Apple's Core Data and file system technologies.
*   **No Cloud Sync:** We do not operate a backend server, and we do not sync your data to any cloud services managed by us.
*   **Backups:** If you use the "Backup" feature, the data is exported to a file that you control. You are responsible for the storage and security of that backup file.

## 3. Third-Party Services
DriveLog does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## 4. Your Rights
Since we do not collect or hold your data, we cannot process requests to access, correct, or delete your data. You have full control over your data directly within the app on your device. You can delete your data at any time by deleting the app or using the "Delete User" function within the app settings.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
